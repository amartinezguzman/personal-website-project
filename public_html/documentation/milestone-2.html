        <p><strong>Web's Design:</strong> The mobile-first design will be simple, cohesive and visually engaging. This
            will
            include only displaying necessary text. A user will be able to navigate this site with ease and quickly
            learn
            about who I am. Some of the featured content will only be available in the desktop version due to spacing
            and
            overall design. </p>
        <p><strong>Navigation:</strong> This section will feature my name and a centered navbar that takes users to
            their
            desired section within the webpage. It will also have a picture (not yet selected) right below that extends
            across the webpage. The main goal of the picture will be to support desired branding throughout and yield
            visual
            interest. </p>
        <p><strong>About Me:</strong> This section will provide a professional picture of myself and a brief
            introduction
            with a welcome message encouraging collaboration. In addition, it will display icons directing users to my
            GitHub & LinkedIn.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills:</strong> This section will provide detailed information highlighting three main components
            regarding my professional and academic skills. All skills will be accompanied by a relevant picture. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Web development</em> will include lists of skills learned in bootcamp and links to capstone & future
                projects.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Education & coaching</em> will provide overview of relevant experience.</li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Community</em> will highlight my work in social justice and community service.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Gallery:</strong> This section will provide a personal touch and provide a user with additional
            information about my interests and hobbies. This will be achieved by displaying pictures that are important
            to
            me. The mobile version will showcase pictures in a carousel. </p>
        <p><strong>Contact:</strong> This section will contain a styled contact form with the option to include a
            message.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Footer:</strong> This section is designed for styling only.</p>
